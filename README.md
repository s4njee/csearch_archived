Congress Search

A fast frontend that uses govtrack.us, sunlightfoundation, and GPO APIs to generate content relevant to the 115th congress(started Feb 2017). 

Not all documents are available for bills displayed; this is due to delays within Congress in updating the GPO(Government Publishing Office)
